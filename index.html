                            For many, this is a first-ever hackathon experience. ZyskaThon isn‚Äôt just about coding; it‚Äôs
                            about
                            learning, growing, and understanding the magic that happens when brilliant minds come
                            together.
                            As a
                            team predominantly in the early stages of our tech careers, this event will be a platform to
                            challenge ourselves, to see the power of collaboration, and most importantly, to enjoy the
                            journey
                            of creation.

              <h3>Feedback:</h3>
    
              <p>Providing feedback, both positive and areas for improvement, is crucial. Each team can grow and learn from your insights.</p>
    
            </li>
    
            
    
            <li>
    
              <h3>Timelines:</h3>
    
              <p>Each team has 3 minutes for presentation and 2 minutes for a Q&A session.</p>
    
              <p>Once all presentations are done, judges will have 30 minutes for discussion and final scoring.</p>
    
            </li>
    
            
    
            <li>
    
              <h3>Announcing Winners:</h3>
    
              <p>The final scores will determine the winner and runner-up. Remember, we have prizes worth INR 40,000 for the winners. Let's ensure our judgment reflects the best choices for these accolades.</p>
